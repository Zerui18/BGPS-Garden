Under PERI Upgrading, Bedok Green Primary School had the opportunity to revamp our eco garden in 2016. The garden was redesigned as a ‘Community Garden’ with the following goals in mind: 
- To support experiential learning; 
- To support the teaching and learning of science;
- To engage the public in the maintenance of green spaces.
There were two key considerations when the garden was redesigned – Plant Selection and Design of Spaces.

Plant Selection
Perennial plants form the backbone of BGPS Community Garden. There are at least 71 different types of plants found in this specially curated garden. Other than showcasing plants that are commonly featured in science lessons (e.g. ferns, cactus, flowering plants), flowering plants that attract pollinators, particularly butterflies, are selected, to promote biodiversity in the garden. Sightings of bats, birds, red dragonfly and butterflies are often shared by BGPS staff, volunteers and students after the garden was completed.

Other plants are also planted for the following purposes: 
(i) Fruit trees - to enhance the vibrancy of the garden; 
(ii) Native plants – to showcase Singapore’s natural heritage;
(iii) Herbs and spices – a hot favourite among BGPS staff, these are planted for their well-being; 
(iv) Ornamental plants – to enhance the vibrancy of the garden and to feature varied leaf forms and their aesthetic appeal.

Design of spaces
Plants are grouped together and each section of the garden is labelled (e.g. Fern Garden and Desert Plants) to show students examples of each type of plants and at the same time, create a visual impact to facilitate their learning. Different types of plants are juxtaposed.  For instance, native plants are placed next to desert plants to highlight how the environment would affect the characteristics of the plants.

Pathways are built to allow students and visitors to have close contact with the plants and other wildlife without hurting and killing them.

Seating areas are also included to allow the elderly visiting our garden to rest and for students to watch events that may take place in the Community Garden. Plots of land are available for students of the Gardening Club to plant crops. Other than experiencing the joy of gardening, the process also helps students to calm down and reduce their stress level.

Since the opening of the Community Garden in May 2017, it has become one of the key resources for Teaching and Learning. Other than science lessons, some Social Studies, Lower Primary PAL and Art lessons are also held there.

In line with the fourth Masterplan for ICT in Education (mp4), a BGPS Garden App was specially created to help students appreciate plant biodiversity and the importance of plant structure in supporting its function.

Students can also learn about the names and interesting facts of each plant from the labels and QR codes, which will lead them primarily to the NParks’ Flora and Fauna page for additional information.
